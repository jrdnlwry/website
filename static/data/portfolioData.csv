1,47% increase in organic leads for a B2b manufacturing client,I was the lead SEO consultant who developed & deployed the strategy,"The client was a global specialty vehicle manufacturer who was looking to drive additional leads for their high margin products.
They had fairly long sales cycles and a fairly expensive product (~$250k per custom vehicle).","I worked with the client to identify the specific products they wanted to drive additional leads.
From there I audited their existing content and found 20% of all their pages were fairly low value.
These were fairly thin pages created by a previous SEO consultant that were harming their SEO efforts. From there I developed a strategy to either consolidate or remove these pages.
Almost immediately we saw an increase in traffic. The next step was to restructure their site navigation and architecture to enhance UX/UI and update the content we decided to keep.
A lot of the conversion points and sales funnels were already well established. This was a matter of driving more qualified organic traffic.
This resulted in a 30% increase in organic traffic and additional 54% increase in leads generated that were directly attributed to organic traffic.",B2B,Speciality Vehicle Manufacturer,6 months,Content,Technical,Research,portfolio-1
2,Led a complex website consolidation across international domains,I was the lead strategist who designed the site migration process,"Our client is a well known business with a large complex website that operates in the research industry.

They served a variety of international markets and wanted to reduce their technical debt.","An SEO audit was done to identify key areas that needed to be consolidated. Next, my team and I delivered recommendations on a new site structure to accomodate the migrated pages. Additionally, we had to deliver scalable SEO solutions that could be deployed site wide as it was a large enterprise site.",B2B,Research,2 months,Technical,Measurement,Strategy,portfolio-2
3,Helped an ecommerce brand recover from a 42% traffic drop,I lead the strategy behind a detailed forensic SEO analysis,"An e-commerce brand needed to recover from a 42% traffic drop and the subsequent loss of ~$50,000 in revenue after a design agency botched a redesign. They needed results urgently and were losing additional revenue each week. There was also no record of the changes made and there were over 100,000 URLs to analyze.","I used a combination of historic versions of the site in the Wayback Machine, data from Google Analytics and Search Console along with crawl data to determine what changes took place, what broke, and how to fix them. Because of the continued revenue loss, I had to condense the audit, deploy the changes and measure their effect to recover as much revenue as quickly as possible. Additionally, because of the sensitive nature I liasoned with the partner marketing agency as well as their internal development resources.",B2C,Ecommerce,1 month,Technical,Measurement,Strategy,portfolio-3
4,Grew user registrations by 64% in under 6 months for a Saas platform,I was the SEO lead who crafted a strategy to hit the aggressive target,A B2B/B2C SaaS platform wanted to grow their organic traffic to drive new user registrations on their platform. Theyâ€™re an extremely high-growth startup with lots of concurrent marketing & development efforts. Any SEO efforts had to compliment the other marketing channels in play.,"I focused on data-driven optimization campaigns and detailed measurements for pages that had some historic conversion rate. Next, I found additional keywords and topics that were added onto key pages to build on top of traffic and revenue that already existed. Finally, I developed an internal linking strategy based on the previously identified key pages to: create a site that was easier for search engines to crawl and emphasize the most important pages.",B2C,Saas,6 months,Technical,Measurement,Content Optimization,portfolio-4
5,Provided visbility into how users were engaging with their app,Lead analytics consultant who developed the measurement strategy.,This was a start up with funding that had a two sided marketplace with a need for visibility into which acquisition channels were profitable or under-performing and which user personas were signing up and downloading their app.,"The first step was to audit the current GA set up to identify the measurement gaps. This step identified a lack of any events, goals, social media pixels or Google ads conversion tracking. Finally, I deployed event, goal tracking and Subdomain tracking to get better visibility into the user journey as they move from the website into the app. Additionally, a custom UTM parameter builder was created within Google Sheets so they client could apply ad hoc tracking parameters on links in newsletters and social media posts.",B2C,Saas,1 month,Technical,Measurement,Strategy,portfolio-5
6,Developed a sales personalization tool,I gathered and translated business requirements into code.,"We repeatedly found our email accounts were getting black listed within G Suite and our deliverability rates were suffering. This was impacting our outbound sales efforts.

Through a lot of research we discovered this was due to an algorithm flagging our emails as spam.

We needed a way to add a layer of personalization to our emails at scale while preserving our profit margins.","I wrote a web scraper in Python to extract specific data points from a Google search. From there I deployed the code using a combination of Streamlit to quickly design the front end without CSS and Heroku to host it.
The program had a user-friendly interface and accepted user input in the form of a CSV file. The tool generated a unique sentence from the combination of scraped data points and static sentence fragments.",B2B,Saas,1 month,Python,Beautifulsoup,Streamlit,portfolio-6
